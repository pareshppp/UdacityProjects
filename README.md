## Deep Learning

### Image Classification

- [Dog Breed Classification - PyTorch](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/project-dog-classification) - Detect whether image contains a human or a dog. If dog, then predict its breed from among 133 classes.
- [NotPineapple (Capstone)](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/Capstone---NotPineapple) - Classify fruit images as Pineaplle or NotPineapple using Keras.
- [CIFAR dataset Classification - PyTorch](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/convolutional-neural-networks/cifar-cnn)
- [CIFAR dataset Classification - Tensorflow](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/Image_Classification_CIFAR-10)

### Natural Language Processing

- [TV Script Generation - PyTorch](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/project-tv-script-generation) - Generate a TV script using LSTM and Word Embeddings.
- [Sentiment Analysis using LSTM - PyTorch](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/blob/master/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/sentiment-rnn/Sentiment_RNN_Exercise.ipynb) - Predict sentiment of Reviews using Word Embeddings and LSTM layers.
- [Char-RNN - PyTorch](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/recurrent-neural-networks/char-rnn) - Implement char-rnn using Pytorch.
- [Word2Vec implementation - PyTorch](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/word2vec-embeddings) - Implement the Word2Vec Skip-Gram model using Pytorch.


### Generative Adversarial Networks

- [MNIST GAN - PyTorch](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/gan-mnist) - Use GANs to generate new MNIST-like images.
- [DCGAN with SVHN dataset - PyTorch](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/blob/master/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/dcgan-svhn/DCGAN_Solution.ipynb) - Use Deep Convolutional Networks to generate new images like Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.
- [CycleGAN - PyTorch](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/cycle-gan) - Generate new images from outlines, using Cycle GANs.


## Classical Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

- [Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/Finding_Donors_for_CharityML) - Use Census data to classify individuals into income brackets.

### Unsupervised Learning

- [Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/Creating_Customer_Segments) - Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Dimensionality Reduction and K-Means / Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to divide customers into segments.

### Reinforcement Learning

- [Train a Simulated Smartcab to Drive](https://github.com/pareshppp/UdacityProjects/tree/master/Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/Training_a_SmartCab_to_Drive) - Use Q-learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world (PyGame) to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time.
